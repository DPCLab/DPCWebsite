          p Scholars <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/43654017" target = "_blank">speculate</a> that approximately 13% of Weibo posts are censored, however no reliable and open source tool to track these censored posts currently exists. This dashboard provides an almost real-time feed of censorship on Weibo and is completely open-source and transparent.

          ul
            li The posts included in our data-set are not a representative sample of Weibo posts.
            li All translations are provided by Google Translate.
            li Not all posts listed in this dashboard were necessarily censored by the government; some may have been deleted by the user who originally posted the content, and others may have been only censored temporarily.
            li Post removal is only one of many ways that Weibo and the Chinese government moderates content online. This dashboard provides a focused—albeit limited—view of Weibo censorship, and, by extension, Chinese censorship more broadly.
